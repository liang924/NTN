### System Function Comparison

| Feature                    | 5G NR NTN                                                                                  | DVB-S2X/RCS2                                                                                         |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Terminal State**         | Supports multiple states: idle, inactive, connected (via RRC); more efficient resource control | Only "connected" or "not connected"; no finer-grained states                                         |
| **Mobility Support**       | Seamless cell reselection and handover, including idle/inactive/connected mode transitions | Supports beam/gateway switch within same network; does not support inter-network handover            |
| **Data Transmission**      | Supports both continuous and burst transmissions of small to medium packets                | DL: continuous large blocks; UL: bursty small packets                                                 |
| **Multi-Connectivity**     | 5GC supports multi-connectivity (e.g., traffic steering, split); evolving for NTN          | Not supported                                                                                         |
| **Positioning Service**    | Supports GNSS and network-assisted positioning                                             | Not supported                                                                                         |
| **Reliability Mechanism**  | HARQ in PHY layer, ARQ in RLC layer                                                        | ARQ possible via vendor-specific methods; not standardized in DVB-S2X or RCS2                         |
| **Power Efficiency**       | Achieved via idle/inactive modes, lean carrier, and power-saving mechanisms                | Not defined                                                                                           |
| **Network Slicing**        | Fully supports end-to-end slicing for differentiated services                              | Not supported                                                                                         |
| **Synchronization** | DL: via periodic Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSB); UL: via Timing Advance (TA), controlled by UE or network | DL: continuous pilot-based sync signals (unless beam hopping); UL: uses dedicated control slots for sync  |
| **Security**         | Well-defined security architecture, supports authentication and PDCP-based encryption/integrity | Some high-level security needs identified, but no standardized framework defined                          |
