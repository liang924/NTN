### Reason for choosing
This is a core document that introduces the overall architecture of 5G and includes the role and integration of NTN within the 5G system.

### Problem Statement
- Traditional 5G architecture is not designed for high-latency satellite links
- Doppler effect causes frequency shift, affecting synchronization and reception quality
- Terrestrial User Equipment (UE) is not designed for satellite scenarios 
- Service continuity requires fast handover and coordination between heterogeneous networks
- Integration between satellite and terrestrial systems introduces architectural complexity 
### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Latency
- Doppler Shift
- Synchronization Performance
- Service Continuity
- UE Power Efficiency
- Signal Quality
- Coverage and Availability
