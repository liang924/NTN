### Reason for Choosing
It introduces how 5G can be integrated with satellite access and explains in which situations this technology is needed and what requirements may arise.
### Problem Statement
- Traditional ground-based 5G networks can’t provide stable signal coverage in remote areas, on the ocean, or in the air (like airplanes).
- When devices switch between ground and satellite networks, the connection often breaks — there’s no seamless handover.
- Current 5G systems and user devices weren’t designed for satellite issues like high latency or frequency drift (Doppler effect).
- Satellite and terrestrial networks follow different rules and management systems, which makes working together complicated.
- To bring satellites into the 5G system, we need to rethink use cases and update the system requirements.

### Key Performance Indicators
