## Superframe

- The **MF-TDMA return link structure** is divided by timeslots in a time Ã— frequency grid, called a **superframe**.
- A superframe is the largest unit for resource allocation, consisting of multiple **frames**, and each frame consists of multiple **timeslots**.
- **In the diagram, the vertical axis represents different carrier frequencies, and the horizontal axis represents time**.
- Each frequency block is associated with a corresponding frame (F_nb), for example:
  - Carrier 0: F_nb 0, 2  
  - Carrier 1: F_nb 6, 8  
  - Carrier 2: F_nb 12, 14, etc.
- The RCST (user terminal) transmits bursts based on the superframe structure assigned by the NCC.
- The superframe has a duration constraint. The RCST must support **superframe durations ranging from 25 ms to 750 ms**.

## Superframe Sequence

- A **Superframe Sequence (SFS)** is a portion of return link bandwidth composed of a series of consecutive superframes of the same type, typically allocated to different RCSTs.
- The diagram shows two sequences: SFS1 (superframes 14 to 16) and SFS2 (superframes 236 to 239).
- Superframes in the same sequence are **continuous in time** and **can be in separate frequency bands**.
- Each superframe has a unique **superframe_count** (like a timestamp or index), with a maximum of 2^16.
- RCSTs schedule their transmissions based on the assigned SFS and are capable of storing the list of assigned logon timeslots.

## Frame

- Each frame is composed of one or more **BTUs (Bandwidth-Time Units)** forming a time-frequency slot grid.
- Horizontal axis: time; vertical axis: frequency. Each cell in the grid is a type-G BTU.
- A single frame may span across multiple carriers, forming a **multi-carrier frame**.

- This figure illustrates a frame composed of different types of BTUs:
  - `TRF1`: 2 BTUs  
  - `TRF2`: 6 BTUs  
  - `CB`: Control burst  
  - `LB`: Logon burst  
  - `G`: General-purpose BTU (usage defined by TBTP2 messages)
- When a frame is received by the RCST, it decodes each BTU based on its assigned type defined in the TBTP2.
- The type of BTU indicates the purpose of the block (data, control, logon, etc.).

## Timeslot
<img width="966" height="254" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/756524a3-a3c7-42a6-b681-f347624bf99c" />

- Each **timeslot** typically contains one burst, which may occupy the entire timeslot duration, with **guard time** reserved to prevent burst interference.
- The figure shows a TRF2-type burst occupying a timeslot built from 6 BTUs.
- **burst_start_offset** defines how the burst is aligned with the start of the timeslot.
- Burst design must consider the appropriate burst type (TRF1, TRF2, CB, LB, etc.), each requiring different timeslot sizes.

## Guard Time
### What is the purpose?
Used to separate consecutive bursts on the same carrier to avoid interference caused by power transients and transmission timing errors.

### How is guard time determined?
It is determined by multiple factors:
- The size of the burst
- The size of the timeslot
- The burst start offset

### Who allocates it?
The NCC (Network Control Center) allocates and controls guard time via:
- `FCT2`
- `BCT`
- `TBTP2`

## The Dynamic MF-TDMA Transmission Channel
###  Core Concepts:
- Each RCST (user terminal) can dynamically use different:
  - Modulation schemes
  - Coding rates
  - Frequencies
  - Symbol rates
  - Start times and durations
###  Where are these parameters defined?
- BTP (Burst Time Plan)
- FCT2
- BCT
###  Dynamic transmission behavior:
- A single RCST may use different timeslots with varying bandwidths and durations.
- As shown in Figure 7-31, the RCST may jump between frequencies over time (indicated by the arrows).
