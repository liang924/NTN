Page 1: Evolution from DVB-S2 to DVB-S2X
DVB-S2 was introduced in 2005, featuring a richer set of MODCODs (modulation and coding combinations) and higher spectral efficiency.
DVB-S2X, released in 2014, introduced key improvements including: finer modulation levels (e.g., 256APSK), reduced gaps between MODCODs, improved time slicing headers, and lower roll-off factors to enhance spectrum utilization.
New technologies enable higher data rates and more compact spectrum usage, and introduced channel bonding and statistical multiplexing.

Page 2: New Technologies and Satellite Applications
Advances in satellite technologies such as ferrite switches, regenerative payloads, and electronically steerable antennas.
Bandwidth can be dynamically allocated to different regions over time, increasing flexibility in capacity utilization.
Studies show these innovations can improve unserved demand by 20%.
To fully leverage these benefits, the DVB-S2 standard was extended.

Page 3: DVB-S2X Waveform Supporting Beam Hopping
Annex E introduces new superframe formats that support multi-beam operations and future waveforms.
Superframe length is now variable, offering more flexibility and better support for fragmentation.
Different superframe formats (e.g., Formats 5, 6, 7) support various operating modes such as periodic and traffic-driven beam hopping.

Page 4: Beam Hopping Operation Strategies
Periodic Beam Hopping: Uses predefined beam hopping cycles, regular and time-based illumination.

Traffic-driven Beam Hopping: Non-periodic scheduling based on traffic demand, offering greater flexibility and efficiency in coverage.

Page 5: Features of Traffic-Driven Beam Hopping
Each packet is directly transmitted to a specific user, improving Quality of Service (QoS).

Enhances scheduling flexibility and reduces latency.

Supports non-periodic, on-demand transmission and operates with fixed-size packet structures.

Page 6: Beam Hopping Application Scenarios
Point-and-shoot transmission improves service flexibility.

Multi-beam operation supports diverse application needs and future scalability.

Different superframe formats (5, 6, 7) are tailored for various SNR environments.

Page 7: DVB-S2X Superframe Formats Supporting Beam Hopping
Format 5: Periodic beam hopping, suitable for low SNR. Uses enhanced preambles and stronger header protection. Supports fragmentation.

Format 6: Traffic-driven, supports very low SNR (VLSNR). Has longer preambles and supports configuration changes.

Format 7: High SNR (> -3 dB), designed for pipelined, high-traffic scenarios.

Page 8: Conclusion and Outlook
DVB-S2X superframe formats are designed to support multiple beam hopping modes and future applications.
Enhanced protection and adaptability to varying bandwidth needs improve spectral efficiency.
Supports a wide range of use cases, including IoT, in-flight connectivity, and data transmission.

Page 9: Data Transmission Performance Test Results
Provides test data for FER (Frame Error Rate) and WER (Word Error Rate) under different SNR conditions.

Uses various formats (SFH, SPH, SPM) to validate identification capability and interference resistance.

Results show that Formats 5 and 6 perform well at high SNR, with only minimal degradation as SNR decreases.

Page 10: Final Conclusion
The DVB-S standard now includes support for beam hopping, meeting the demands of commercial applications.
It is a mature standard developed through collaboration across multiple companies, with future-proof capabilities and ease of maintenance and upgrade.
