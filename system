# NTN data collation

### 🔸 1. What does this system do?

It converts digital signals from MPEG transport stream multiplexers or generic sources  
→ into a format suitable for **satellite transmission**.

---

### 🔸 2. What data formats are supported?

The system supports:
- **MPEG Transport Streams (TS)**
- **Generic Streams (GS)**
- And optionally **Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE)**

---

### 🔸 3. What is the design goal?

To achieve **Quasi Error Free (QEF)** transmission quality.

---

### 🔸 4. What does QEF mean?

If signal quality is good (above C/N+I threshold):
- At a bitrate of 5 Mbps (e.g., single TV service),
- There will be **less than one uncorrected error per hour**
- Meaning: **Packet Error Ratio (PER) < 10⁻⁷**
